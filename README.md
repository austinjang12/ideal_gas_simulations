# ideal_gas_simulations

This is the code I programmed for my AP Chemistry Extra Credit Ideal Gas Law video. 

Feel free to tweak the code to explore simulating Ideal Gases more. Use Python version 3.13+ to run Boyle's, Charles's, and Gay-Lussac's Law.

For files introscene.py and singleparticlesim.py, use Python version 3.11.8 to run the Manim library to animate videos.

Enjoy!
